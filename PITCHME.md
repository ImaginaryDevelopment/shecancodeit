## Logical and Physical Line
A physical line is what you see when you write the program. A logical line is what Python sees as a single statement. Python implicitly assumes that each physical line corresponds to a logical line.

## Indentation
* Whitespace is important in Python.
* Leading whitespace (spaces and tabs) at the beginning of the logical line determines Indentation
* Statements that must go together must have the same indentation
