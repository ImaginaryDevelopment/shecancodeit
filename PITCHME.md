## Logical and Physical Line
* A physical line is what you see when you write the program.
* A logical line is what Python sees as a single statement.
* Python implicitly assumes that each physical line corresponds to a logical line.

## Indentation
* Whitespace is important in Python.
* Leading whitespace (spaces and tabs) at the beginning of the logical line determines indentation
* Statements that must go together must have the same indentation
